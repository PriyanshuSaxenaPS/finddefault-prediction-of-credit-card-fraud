# FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card fraud)

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting credit card fraud using various outlier detection techniques. The goal is to classify transactions as either fraud or normal based on transaction attributes.

## Data
- **Dataset**: `creditcard.csv` contains transaction records with features and a target label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
- **Raw Data**: Located in the `data/raw` folder.
- **Processed Data**: This folder is for any cleaned or transformed datasets.

## Files and Scripts
- `notebooks/data_exploration_and_preprocessing.py`: Script for data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- `notebooks/model_building_and_evaluation.py`: Script for building and evaluating outlier detection models.

## Visualizations
- Visualization plots are saved in the `visuals` folder. 

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the scripts in `notebooks` folder to explore the data, preprocess, and build models.

## Dependencies
Refer to `requirements.txt` for a list of required libraries.
